    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: March 2024</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Malpeli App privacy policy. This policy explains how our app handles your data and permissions, with a particular focus on camera usage and other device features.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>WebView Implementation</h2>
        <p>Our app primarily functions as a WebView wrapper for malpeli.co.uk. This means the app provides a mobile-optimized way to access our website's content and features.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Camera Permission Usage</h2>
        <p>The app requests camera permission for the following specific purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>QR Code Scanning: To scan QR codes when this feature is accessed through the website</li>
            <li>Photo/Video Capture: To allow you to take photos or videos when uploading content through the website</li>
            <li>File Upload: To enable camera access when choosing files to upload through the website</li>
            <li>Flashlight/Torch: To provide flashlight functionality when needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The app itself does not store, collect, or transmit any photos, videos, or camera data. All media handling is done through the website's secure interface.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
        <p>The app itself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does not store any photos or videos captured using the camera</li>
            <li>Does not collect any camera or media data</li>
            <li>Does not share camera access with third parties</li>
            <li>Only provides camera access when explicitly requested by website features</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any data collection, storage, or processing is handled entirely by the website (malpeli.co.uk) according to its own privacy policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>User Control</h2>
        <p>You maintain full control over camera permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Camera permission can be granted or revoked at any time through your device settings</li>
            <li>The app will request permission before accessing the camera for any feature</li>
            <li>You can deny camera access and still use the app's other features</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or how we handle camera permissions, please contact us at [Contact Email].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
